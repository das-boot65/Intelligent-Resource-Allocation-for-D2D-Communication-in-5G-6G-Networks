📡 Intelligent Resource Allocation for D2D Communication in 5G/6G Networks
🔍 Overview

This project explores the use of reinforcement learning to optimize device-to-device (D2D) communication in 5G/6G networks. Using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based multi-agent framework, we designed a scalable solution to allocate resources efficiently in edge-computing environments.

The system improves throughput, energy efficiency, and adaptability, offering a promising direction for next-generation wireless communication systems.
