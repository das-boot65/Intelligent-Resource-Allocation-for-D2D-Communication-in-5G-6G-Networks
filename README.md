##  Overview
This project presents a **reinforcement learning**â€“driven approach using PPO to optimize **device-to-device (D2D) communication** in **5G/6G networks**. Designed for simulation in **edge computing environments**, it improves **throughput**, **energy efficiency**, and **adaptability**, offering a scalable solution for next-gen wireless systems.

---

##  Objectives
- **Optimize** spectrum and power allocation in D2D communication  
- **Minimize** interference while ensuring high spectral efficiency  
- **Improve** energy efficiency and provide robust QoS (Quality of Service)  
- **Demonstrate** scalability of AI-driven methods in 5G/6G networks

##  System Architecture

**Network Model**  
- Simulates a cellular base station with multiple D2D pairs sharing spectrum.

**Resource Allocation Framework**  
- Multi-agent PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) dynamically assigns channels and power.  
- **State**: wireless channel quality, interference, traffic load  
- **Action**: channel selection, power level assignment  

**Reward Function**  
- Designed to boost **throughput**, reduce **power use**, and ensure **fairness**.

##  Simulation Setup
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow / PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment**: Simulated 5G/6G and edge-computing infrastructure  
- **Metrics**:
  - Throughput (Mbps)
  - Energy efficiency (bits/Joule)
  - Fairness
  - Adaptability under varied conditions
